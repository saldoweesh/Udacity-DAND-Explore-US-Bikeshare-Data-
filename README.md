# Exploring US Bikeshare Data
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major bike-share systems in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and wrote code to compute descriptive statistics and visualize data. Mainly, I tried to answer the following questions: 

- Does trips' amount increase or decrease during weekends ?
- Does trips' amount increase or decrease during workdays ?
- Which city has the largest number of trips ?

Language: Python 

Libraries: 
- csv 
- datetime 
- pprint
- matplotlib.pyplot
